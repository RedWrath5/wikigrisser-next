Updating when global release comes out:
When a units global release comes out some changes will need to be made in the google sheets to reflect the now official names of units, classes and skills

On the Heroes sheet please review the new units  Name (A), Talent Name (C), Description (D), Classes and skill names (X- BJ), Names of classes in Heart Bonds (CE and CF), 3c Name (DL) 
Please upate the names in Skills an Classes sheets to ensure they match as well.

Aditionally, IF the name is updated, the name will need to be update on the Heroes cards, talents, heroes folder for that skin, and hero skins in the folder. 

Skills will need skill image updated

Classes will need Classes image updated.

Futhermore for the Update please check
Casting Name (DW)
Exclusives Name (CK)
Exclusive Equipment image will also need to be updated.

And as always check translations, and be aware sometimes zilong messes up.
